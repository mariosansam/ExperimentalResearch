				<h4 align="center">Preface</h4>
				<p align="center"><i>"By that time we were already in the middle of the McCarthyism. McCarthy had told the army to retire some "corrupted" books of foreign libraries. The once before general, and by that time president Eisenhower, one of the few brave men of that year, ordered to put those book back to the shelves.</i></p>
				<p align="center"><i>In the meantime, our search of a magazine willing to publish the chapters of Fahrenheit 451 was in a deadpoint. No one wanted to take the risk with a novel about censorship, future, present or past.</i></p>
				<p align="center"><i>Then it happened. A young editor from Chicago, low on cash but visionary, saw my manuscript and bought it for 450 dollars, all he had. He published it in the numbers 2, 3 and 4 of the magazine he was about to release.</i></p>
				<p align="center"><i>His name was Hugh Hefner. The magazine was Playboy, created in the winter between 1953 and 1954 to shock and improve the world. The rest is history. After that modest beginning, a corageous editor in an scared country survived and triumphed. When I saw him again a few months ago in the opening of one of his offices in California, he shaked my hand and said: "Thank for being there"."</i></p>
				<p align="center"><h7>Fahrenheit 451 Preface, Ray Bradbury. 1993</h7></p>
				<p align="center">1963. August. 12 science fiction writers (Poul Anderson, Isaac Asimov, James Blish, Ray Bradbury, Algis Budrys, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein, Frederik Pohl, Rod Serling, Theodore Sturgeon, William Tenn and A.E. Van Vogt) shared their predictions about the future in an article of the Playboy Magazine called <i>1984 and Beyond</i>. 12 experienced writers who had dreamt about space travels and extra-terrestrial colonies set aside the fiction to talk about science and try to give an accurate vision of the world in the next 20 years. </p>
				<p align="center"><i>Manifesto of the future</i> collects one predictions and one reality. <i>How it was</i> summons the main basis these 12 minds imagined of the future. <i>How it is</i> compares them with the times we live in, not as dreamful as they thought.</p>

				<h4 align="center">How it was</h4>
				<h4 align="center">I</h4>
				<p align="center">All illnesses, from psychosis to heart disease, plus all sensory aids such as glasses and hearing aids will be extinct by 2000. </p>
				<h4 align="center">II</h4>
				<p align="center">The average life span of children born in 1963 will be 200 years. </p>
				<h4 align="center">III</h4>
				<p align="center">It will be possible to restore life to those inconvenienced by accidental death. </p>
				<h4 align="center">IV</h4>
				<p align="center">By 1984, cars will be steered from a central control, not driven by their owners. </p>
				<h4 align="center">V</h4>
				<p align="center">By 1984, wage-earning will no longer be important. Robots will do all the dull, routine jobs. The three viable careers for a young playboy will be cyberneticist (a sort of glorified repair man and machine tender), technical research or communications. </p>
				<h4 align="center">VI</h4>
				<p align="center">Thanks to inflation, communications will pay handsomely – as much as 50K a year. Our playboy will work approximately 20 hours a week and enjoy an annual three month vacation as well as  unlimited paid sick time – which he won’t need since a pill can cure any malady. </p>
				<h4 align="center">VII</h4>
				<p align="center">A food-processing machine will prepare the best recipes by the greatest chefs by following a coded tape. Robots will do all housework. </p>
				<h4 align="center">VIII</h4>
				<p align="center">The need for sleep will be obsolete. </p>
				<h4 align="center">IX</h4>
				<p align="center">Tailored suits made by automaton will be as disposable as Kleenex. Alternatively, suits may be wired for sight and sound, never need to be cleaned, pressed or repaired. </p>
				<h4 align="center">X</h4>
				<p align="center">A typical date might include a rocket to Hawaii for dinner followed by a monorail ride across the mountains of the moon. </p>

				<h4 align="center">How it is</h4>
				<h4 align="center">I</h4>
				<p align="center">Not only they aren’t extinct, heart related diseases are today’s main cause of mortality in the world. People still have psychosis. People still wear glasses. It’s true that improvements in the health field have made life better for those suffering certain (most) diseases, but they are still there.</p>
				<p align="center">In a future, Transhumanism may be a reality. Advances in robotic science will allow the hybridization between humans and robots. The human body will be enhanced by the implementation of technology. Parts of the body will be replaced with them robotic analogous and the connection will be made at neurological level</p>
				<h4 align="center">II</h4>
				<p align="center">Life span has increased drastically in the last 50 years. From the ~45 years estimated in the 50s, the number has raised up to 65. Better life conditions and science advances has made this possible, but more than 700 million people still live below the poverty line. Far away from those 200 years.</p>
				<p align="center">Related with the point before, life span will increase thanks to artificial organs, more effective than the real ones. World will be even more polarized than now, with an elite who can afford this treatments and a vast majority of the population who can't. The film Repo Men (Miguel Sapochnik, 2010) explores this future.</p>
				<h4 align="center">III</h4>
				<p align="center">Although medical treatments are way better now than they used to be in the 60s, restoration of life hasn't been accomplished yet, at least not in an overwhelming way. What we have reduced is the number of casualties in accidents due to improvements in the security of the vehicles. </p>
				<h4 align="center">IV</h4>
				<p align="center">This vision of a worldwide RC transport would be a dream for those who suffer everyday’s traffic during rush hour, but the reality is more boring. The closest we are is thanks to the rich investors as Elon Musk. Tesla cars are capable of be driven by themselves and they promise to drastically decrease the number of accidents in the roads. However, high prices and careless normal-cars’ drivers make it difficult to come to reality.</p>
				<p align="center">In some years, most of the cars on the roads will be self-driven as the prices will decrease. Also, more friendly cities and improvements in public transport will reduce the amout of private cars.</p>
				<h4 align="center">V</h4>
				<p align="center">In 2017, wage-earning are nevertheless important. Furthermore, capitalism is more powerful than ever and these robots doing all the dull, routine jobs are seen by a vast number of people as a problem (those who lose their jobs in exchange of a machine) and as a potential gold mine by those who own the factories. Countries as Finland and Netherlands are starting to study implementing a Universal Basic Income.</p>
				<h4 align="center">VII</h4>
				<p align="center">They were right about this. At least partly. The first model of the Thermomix© came out in 1961. After 50 years of improvements, the quality of the dishes has improved, but nothing compared with the <i>"best recipes by the greatest chefs"</i>, as they thought.</p>
				<p align="center">In fact, some entrepreneurs nowadays are looking in the other direction. Rob Rhinehart created in 2013, thanks to a crowdfunding campaign, a food substitute in form of powder called <i>Soylent</i> (as a nod to the 1973 film). The reason, in a nutshell, was that eating physical food entail a loss of time.</p>
				<h4 align="center">VIII</h4>
				<p align="center">Sleeping is an inherent necessity of the human being. The average hours needed by the body to recover after a day of working are 7 hours. We haven't discovered anything yet that replace sleeping as a way of recovering energy.</p>
				<h4 align="center">IX</h4>
				<p align="center">Tailored suits aren’t disposable and don’t seem to be in a near future. Nonetheless, during the last years the development of 3D printers has advanced exponentially, being possible to print clothes and even food. A day will come that people will be able to print their clothes at home and designers will sell the blueprints online.</p>
				<h4 align="center">X</h4>
				<p align="center">The fastest commercial transport method up to today is the Concorde. Was used from 1976 to 2003, being retired due to a fatal accident in France. It was capable of going from Paris to NY in 3.30 hours. Since the retirement of the Concorde none other vehicle has been able to achieve those times. The future of public transportation is, again, in hands of Elon Musk. His company Hyperloop© promise to achieve velocities of 1.100km/h, far from the 2.179 of the Concorde, but making long-distance trips accessible to a wider range of people.</p>
				<p align="center">Regarding the travel to the moon, NASA and other space companies are pointing slightly further: Mars. Optimistic estimations point to 2039 as the year we’ll achieve arriving to the red planet. Some private investor and researchers are studying the possibilities of creating a settlement. The problem is that, until we have the technology to create more efficient spaceships capable of returning to the Earth, is a one-way ticket.</p>
